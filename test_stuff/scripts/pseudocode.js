// 1-- MAKE LOGIC WORK --> SHUFFLE, DRAW, RECOGNIZE BUST, MAKE ACE WORK

    // -- SHUFFLE / DRAW (PULL RANDOM NUMBER FROM ARRAY)

    // -- RECOGNIZE BUST

    // -- RECOGNIZE BLACKJACK

    // -- FUNCTIONAL ACE

// 2-- DO DEALER (look up rules-- when to continue drawing) 

// 3-- BETTING (can't bet negative, can't bet more than you have) -- DONE!

// 4-- BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY

// 5-- HIDE ONE DEALER CARD

    // -- ADD A CSS CLASS TO FIRST DEALER'S CARD?

// can input box accept given input?


// KNOWN PROBLEMS AND OTHER NOTES

// player's start amount hardcoded into html -- DONE!

// should move playerbalance to message div function to somewhere else -- DONE!

// is there a way to post message once if user keeps pressing button?

// need to remove drawn cards from the deck -- DONE

// deal and draw can probably be combined into one function -- NO!

// turn off play button until end of the round -- DONE!

// game logic (adding card values) only works for the first two -- DONE!
  // what was the problem here again?

// ADDED CLASS CLICKED TO PLAY-- REMEMBER TO REMOVE IT!!!!!!!
